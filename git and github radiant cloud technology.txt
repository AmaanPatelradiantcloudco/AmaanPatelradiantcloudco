   mamking a change over here
   we now have distributed version control system
     earlier we used to have centralized version control system
git is usually used to save your things and version of the software it is one of the powerfool tools to ull a request push a requets branching and merging.
for eg lets say you have made snapchat and the client says remove some features from the version 1.0 and you have updated the version to 2.3 for eg, so how would you get back to think which exact features should be deleted for the same the client says add the features from version 1.4 so hw would u be able to do that you have to write a text file what process have you done or you might be using dropbox and copying code analyzing things well that's a lot of stuff you are doing we have got you covered says git.
centralized version system:your code will be saved on server if the server fails you will loose the the code and won't be able to work on it till the server issue is solved fro eg. you are in an aeroplane and you lost your internet connection so you won't be able to work on that
Distributed version control system:In the git which is a dvcs which stores or have a copy of your local repository so even if the server fails you don't have to worry you can change the code and modify and when you connect with the server you can push the code.for eg even if you are in aeroplane you don't have to care about the internet issues because git offers you your personal local repository you can work on.

if someone says you,you have abug in your version 4.7 and you are currently working on version 5.0 how do you reslove the issue.here the trunk based model or the branching comes into the picture.you can change make changes in 4.7 and commit //commit is similar to saving and you can create a barnch for this so you will code in version 5.0 and
